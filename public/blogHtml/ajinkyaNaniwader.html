          <p>
            The world has already stepped into the fundamental phase of the 4.0
            Industrial Revolution. We all technocrats are on a verge of
            developing high-tech sustainable solutions to existing issues with
            the help of Big Data technologies, Artificial Intelligence and
            Machine Learning. The booming realm of Artificial Intelligence with
            the recent production of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT, Bard and Big
            Data tools such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark are playing a
            paramount technical role in remodelling human lives and minimizing
            human effort. Big Data Analytics is being used in multifarious
            domains to produce effective outcomes thereby enhancing the
            decision-making ability of large firms by providing quality service.

            Whether we have to decide about taking a road with less traffic or
            to book a table in our favourite restaurant, it is Big Data
            Analytics that’s making life easy. But what actually is Big Data and
            why is it so important? The term 'Big Data' simply refers to an
            enormous collection of large and complex datasets collected from
            various sources. Big Data is really huge and manipulating it is a
            cumbersome task indeed. Volume, Variety, Value, Velocity are the
            characteristic features of Big Data. Initially, it is just a bulk of
            information from which useful insights and outcomes can be derived
            only after numerous steps of data processing. Analysing Big Data and
            identifying trends and patterns is not a cakewalk. Data cleaning is
            a crucial fundamental step that contributes to the accuracy and
            reliability of the data under analysis. A series of steps such as
            Data Collection, Data Exploration, Handling missing data, Handling
            outliers, Standardization, Normalization, Sampling, Quality
            assessment, etc. have to be implemented before we finally reach our
            end result. <br />
            <br />
            Through Big Data Analytics, we are privileged to identify the
            existence of underlying patterns and pre plan subsequently for the
            future by analysing current trends. Today, we are able to get a
            precise prediction about futuristic changes that may happen in any
            of the fields of Finance, HealthCare, Advertising, Education, Stock
            Market, etc through Big Data Analytics. It is influencing the
            business models and profitability of organizations. Companies use it
            to brainstorm their decision- making abilities and continue to
            outperform their competitors. Moreover, we can see the positive
            uplifting impact of Big Data in the healthcare industry. This has
            led to a rapid improvement in early diagnosis of patients,
            predicting the onset of possible diseases and the production of
            potent pharmacological drugs and vaccines beforehand. In this way,
            Big Data Analytics is uplifting and harmonizing human lives in
            healthcare industry. <br />
            <br />

            Among the trending Big Data tools Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark,
            Elasticsearch are some of the widely used. Apache Hadoop is a
            distributed processing framework that manages and processes large
            datasets across clusters of computers. Hadoop comes up with its
            storage system called HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and the
            MapReduce programming model. For example, Walmart uses Hadoop to
            track its sales trend. It identifies products that are selling well
            and makes decisions accordingly regarding its inventory levels,
            pricing and marketing campaigns.

            <br />
            <br />

            Apache Hadoop has helped Walmart to gain insights into customer
            satisfaction thereby strengthening its business activities. Another
            example is Netflix which also uses Hadoop to process data from its
            streaming service. This data includes information about the
            preference of audience for movies and TV shows. Analytics on data
            pertaining to factors such as duration of movies watched, ratings
            given to watched content have earned Netflix deeper customer
            insights thereby personalizing the user experience. Of course, there
            are some areas where Big Data poses several challenges to the
            society. Protecting data and maintaining data privacy is one such
            important issue which can’t be overlooked. We must be aware about
            our data and save it from any unauthorized access. It is possible to
            transform this planet into a better living place by the parallel
            development, research and implementation of human ideas with the
            help of technology.
